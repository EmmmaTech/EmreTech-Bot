Rule 1: No Spamming

Rule 2: No inappropriate content, keep it PG-13

- This includes NSFW, excessive use of swearing, and racial, sexual, or any kind of slurs.

Rule 3: Don't post the same message in different channels

- If you really need help, just wait. Someone will get to you eventually. If you do this twice, you'll get kicked.

Rule 4: Be nice and respectful

- Other people are at different understanding of this stuff, and it's rude to be mean to them. If you aren't respectful, you'll get kicked.

Rule 5: If you can't help someone out, then don't help

- This might be hard to swallow, but if you don't know how to help someone, then don't help them. Someone else might help them eventually

Rule 6: No linking to pirated content

- Discussion of piracy is fine, but linking to piracy sites/uploading pirated content will get you an instant ban.

Rule 7: Check pinned comments or channels in the Info category

Rule 8: Don't fight, or try to raid someone else's server

- Mild disagreement is fine (i.e. argument about what programming language is the best) but if it gets too personal, take it to DMs

- No exceptions to this rule

Rule 9: Don't DM @EmreTech, @Admin, or @Mods unless it's super important

- For example, if you DM us just to say Hi, you'll be warned. If you DM us about something to change with my code, then we'll be fine about it.

Rule 10: Don't DM Admins or Mods to give you access to the rest of the server

- This is an additional rule to Rule 9, because this doesn't count as important

- When you are done reading the rules, type in ?verify into this channel to gain access to the rest of the server.

Rule 11: Don't beg me or any Admins or Mods to get roles

- If you really want to have a role, you have to earn it
